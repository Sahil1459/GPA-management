# GPA Management System

This is a C++ project for managing student grades and faculty information at **Government Polytechnic Awasari (GPA)**. The system provides role-based access for students, teachers, and HODs to efficiently manage academic data.

## Features
- **Student Management**: Add, update, and delete student records.
- **Grade Management**: Teachers can enter and update student marks.
- **Subject Management**: HODs assign subjects and teachers.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login for students, teachers, and HODs.

## Technologies Used
- **C++** for core logic
- **MySQL** for database management
- **MySQL Connector/C++** for database connectivity
- **Visual Studio** as the development environment

## Setup Instructions

To set up the GPA Management System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Software**:
   - Ensure you have **MySQL Server** installed on your machine. You can download it from the [MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).
   - Install **MySQL Connector/C++**, which allows your C++ application to interact with the MySQL database. You can find it [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/cpp/).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open your command line or terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sahil1459/GPA-management.git

## Development Environment

The GPA Management System is developed using **Visual Studio**, which provides an integrated development environment (IDE) for C++. Visual Studio offers features such as:

- **IntelliSense**: Provides code suggestions and auto-completion, making coding more efficient.
- **Debugger**: A powerful debugging tool to identify and fix issues quickly.
- **Project Management**: Organize and manage project files and settings effectively.

### Setting Up Visual Studio
1. Download and install **Visual Studio** from the [official website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
2. Choose the **Desktop development with C++** workload during installation.
3. Once installed, open the GPA Management System project and configure the MySQL Connector/C++ library in your project settings.

Using Visual Studio ensures a smooth development experience with helpful tools and features.
